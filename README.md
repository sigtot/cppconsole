# cppconsole
A very simple c++ console for running quick small code segments

# Quick usage guide
All this program does is put your code inside a main function, compiling and executing it. iostream and stdio.h are included by default at the top of the document. Other libraries can be included with `#include` (these statements will also be placed outside the main function, and remain for the rest of the session). `using namespace std` will also be enabled by default. For more info, see the help section.
